# Project 2

This is the second iteration of Alone in Rads that will feature using data core, the other requirements, and hopefully extras if possible.

So far, I've gotten the app icon to work, but the launch screen image is not working for some reason, but it's still set in xCode so I don't know after looking at a bunch of forums and suggestions.

I then added core data entities and their relationships and just require to implement storing and retrieving the data that the player will input or use.

I'm not sure how far we have to go into implementing each entitie and relationship we made for the core data requirement, but I've made use of it by storing a players name, then creating a game state that will save that, and also store the latest location available at character creation time. So a location isn't required, the game will tell you to set your location, but is entirely optional. No errors will be thrown at the user like it did to me when I was first debugging this.
