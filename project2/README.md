# Project 2

This is the second iteration of Alone in Rads that will feature using data core and some other requirements.

So far, I've gotten the app icon to work, but the launch screen image is not working for some reason, but it's still set in xCode so I don't know after looking at a bunch of forums and suggestions.

I then added core data entities and their relationships and just require to implement storing and retrieving the data that the player will input or use.
