## Base Score

7/7 = 80%



## Extras

10 - As mentioned in HW2's feedback, this will need to be native Swift, maybe SpriteKit, but we haven't covered that in detail. It'll also need a lot more mobile technologies built into it such as a database, camera, GPS, etc. It'll need some of the additional things we've covered in class or the grade for the final project may suffer.



# Final Score

80 + 10 = 90%
