# Final Project Feedback



## Requirements:

You’ll be graded on the following areas:

1. (1/3%) **Technology** - Implementing more technologies (Core Data, camera, location, web services, animations, sounds, SceneKit, HealthKit, CocoaPods, camera, location manager etc). The more the better. Since each app is different try to implement at least 3 major mobile technologies. If you’re unsure, ask!
2. (1/3%) **Creative** - The design of the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and general creativity of the app, the idea and the implementation. Go to [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create) for color scheme ideas.
3. (1/3%) **Originality** - How original is the idea, and the implementation. This is subjective, but if your app reproduces other apps, this will likely result in a lower grade for this area. Example: A restaurant finder is not very original, but a Boise restaurant finder for college students, with a bus schedule, may be more original. Also, the implementation of the app matters. 
4. **5 minute presentation** 15 point penalty for missing this requirement.



## Base Score

## Comments

- I would have liked to see a bit more in the design area. The text was the main interface into the game, so that needed to take up more space and perhaps have larger font. Part of the learning experience is biting off more than you can chew but there could have been a few easy wins here such spending a bit of time on the design and cleaning that up a bit. I gave you a slightly higher score on creativity for the text. I'd love to see this built out more in the future or if you decide to build something else, I'd love to hear about it!
