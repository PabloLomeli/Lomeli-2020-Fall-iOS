# Project 1

This will be the first iteration of Alone in Rads. 

The app so far is kind of what I want it to look like, depending on how project 2 and final project go I want to keep the menu I have for in place that uses the UITable look. I'm not sure how core data will be used yet but I'm excited to look into it more to make my avatar and map data persistent and be used throughout "the game".

I want to add a feature that updates your location depending on where you move the map to and need to get a good sketch down for the main menu picture instead of the trash icon I have in place.
