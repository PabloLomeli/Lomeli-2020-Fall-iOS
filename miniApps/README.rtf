This is the readme hopefully? I just started using macOS and I'm kind of new to all this.

I wanted to make it clear that miniApps is HW1 for CS402, I will make sure to email you so that you won't have to dig through this readme hopefully, but incase you do this is the readme.

PS Please use iPhone 11, I tried messing with the constraints and adding aspect ratio constraints but it would not work with me tonight so I'm only supporting iPhone 11 or bigger screens.
